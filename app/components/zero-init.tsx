  // TODO: OK this is not great ðŸ˜… and will be improved.
  //
  // Couple things going on:
  //
  // 1. Despite the name, we don't want "preload" queries to generally block the
  //    queries made by the UI. We need better nomenclature here maybe. But
  //    generally I think these queries should be lower-priority and allow the
  //    data the UI actually needs to get synced first.
  //
  // 2. We have found that setting a long ttl is not a good idea for most apps,
  //    because as the app changes, the developer changes the queries they want,
  //    but we keep syncing old queries with long ttls anyway even though the
  //    app doesn't need them.
  //
  //    Anyway, the way ttl works is it only comes into play when a query is
  //    *not* active (when a window is running that does *not* include the
  //    query). So for the common preload case the ttl doesn't need to be long,
  //    because the preload query is always running. Basically it just needs to
  //    be long enough so that the query doesn't accidentally get evicted during
  //    page navigation. A minute is plenty.
  //
  // We are going to rework the ttl API to take both of these into account, but
  // for now we do not recomend ttls longer than 1h, and for preload we only
  // recommend 1m.
  //
  // PS: You are probably wondering about calling preload() multiple times here
  // due to re-renders. It's fine. Zero dedupes queries.
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Why this particular preload?
    //
    // The goal of Zero generally is for every user interaction to be instant.
    // This relies fundamentally on preloading data. But we cannot preload
    // everything, so preloading is at core about guessing data user will most
    // likely need. This is different in every app. Zero gives you the full
    // power of queries to express and orchestrate whatever preload sequence you
    // want.
    //
    // For this app, the primary interface is a search box. Users are more
    // likely to search for popular artists than unpopular so we preload the
    // first 1k artists by popularity.
    //
    // Note that we don't also preload their albums. We could, but there's no
    // reason to as the list UI will do that. We know the user can't navigate to
    // an album they don't see in the UI, so there's no point in preloading
    // more.
    //
    // There is also an interesting interaction with the UI. Since we will get
    // instant local results and full server results async, we ideally want to
    // avoid having the UI jostle. So we want to preload in the same order we
    // tend to display in the UI. That way local results are always also the
    // top ranked results.
